                  To log in, enter your registration number and password following the instructions provided to you by the invigilator.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The total duration of the test is 120 minutes. For PwD candidates, the total duration is 160 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The test has 3 (three) sections. The time allotted to each section is 40 minutes (53 minutes and 20 seconds for PwD candidates). As soon as the candidate visits a section, the clock (displayed as "Time Left" in the top right corner of the screen) will start. On completion of 40 minutes, the clock will stop, the particular section will be locked, and the answers to questions in that section will be auto-submitted. The candidate will then need to proceed to the next section. The exact same process will be repeated in the other two sections. After submitting all three sections, a summary of the answers will appear on the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For PwD candidates, the process will be the same as above. The only exception is that, for each section, the PwD candidate will have 53 minutes and 20 seconds, with an option for submitting the answers of a section at any point in time after the completion of 40 minutes by clicking on the 'Submit' button. After 53 minutes and 20 seconds, however, the section test will automatically end. Therefore, PwD candidates can complete all three sections of the test within a maximum of 160 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The candidate's computer time will be synchronized with the server clock. The countdown timer ("Time Left") at the top right corner of the computer screen indicates the remaining time to complete the current section. When the timer reaches zero, the section test will automatically end.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No candidate will be allowed to leave the test hall before 120 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A writing pad will be provided to candidates for rough work, which must be returned after the test. Please note that for PwD candidates, two writing pads will be provided, while others will receive only one. Candidates should clearly write their name and registration number at the designated place on the writing pad.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The question paper will include a mix of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) with options and Non-MCQs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For an MCQ, a candidate will receive 3 marks for a correct answer, -1 mark for a wrong answer, and 0 marks for an unattempted question.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For a Non-MCQ, a candidate will receive 3 marks for a correct answer and 0 marks for both wrong and unattempted questions. There will be no negative marking for incorrect answers in non-MCQ questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An MCQ will have four choices, of which only one is correct. The computer assigned to the candidate at the test center operates on specialized software that allows only one answer per MCQ.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The candidate's answers will be updated and saved on a server periodically.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An on-screen calculator will be provided, which can be used for computing. The candidate will not be allowed to use any other calculator, computing machine, or device.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Candidates are expected to familiarize themselves with various symbols before starting the test. The question palette displayed on the right side of the screen will show the status of each question with the help of one of the following symbols:
